# UbuntuSetupScript
My Personal Setup Script for new Ubuntu Installs

Notes:

* The ```00``` script is optional. If you're using BTRFS and want to setup shapshots, ```timeshift``` is a great utility. Additionally, it also adds a timeshift plugin/extension that enables automatic snapshots every time you perform an ```apt-update```.
